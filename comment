To use the script, save it as "user_rotate.sh" and make it executable with chmod +x user_rotate.sh. Then run it as root or with sudo privileges: sudo ./user_rotate.sh.

Please note that this script should be used with caution, as it automatically creates new user accounts and changes passwords without any confirmation. Make sure to adapt it to your specific requirements and test it in a safe environment
