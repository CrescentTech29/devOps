To install and configure Jenkins on Red Hat-based servers using Ansible, you can create a playbook called `jenkins_install.yml`. This playbook will:

1. Install Java (OpenJDK).
2. Add the Jenkins repository.
3. Install and start the Jenkins service.
4. Configure the firewall to allow access to the Jenkins web interface.

Make sure you have Ansible installed on the control node and that the target Red Hat-based servers are listed in your inventory file (e.g., `/etc/ansible/hosts`).
