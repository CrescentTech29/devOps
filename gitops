itOps is a modern approach to continuous delivery that uses Git as a single source of truth for both infrastructure-as-code (IAAC) and application code. Here's a possible GitOps strategy for IAAC and application codes:

Version control: All IAAC and application code should be stored in version control using Git. Each change to the code should be committed to a branch, and a pull request should be created for code review.

CI/CD pipeline: A continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline should be set up to automatically build and test the code whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository.

Infrastructure as Code: The IAAC should be written using a tool such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, and the code should be stored in the Git repository alongside the application code. The IAAC should be designed to be deployed automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

Automated Deployment: Once the IAAC has been deployed, the application code should be deployed automatically using a tool such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The deployment process should be triggered automatically whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository.

Monitoring and Alerting: The deployed application should be monitored using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack. Alerts should be set up for any potential issues with the infrastructure or application.

Rollbacks and Recovery: A rollback plan should be in place in case of any issues with the IAAC or application code. A backup and restore plan should also be in place to ensure that data can be recovered in the event of a disaster.

Overall, the GitOps strategy for IAAC and application codes involves version controlling all the code, automating the deployment process, and monitoring the deployed application to ensure its reliability and availability. By following this strategy, teams can achieve faster and more reliable software delivery.
